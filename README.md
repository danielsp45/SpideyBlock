# Spidey Block

## Laboratórios de Informática I

This project was developed during the first semester of the first year of the Computer Science and Engineering Degree.
It is fully developed in Haskell and it consists of 6 tasks:
- **Task 1** Task 1 is where in-game maps are checked to see if they are eligible to be played.
- **Task 2** The maps in the game have two formats, in this task two functions were created to be able to transfer maps from one format to the other.
- **Task 3** In this task the game gains its graphical structure in the terminal.
- **Task 4** Task 4 is where the game mechanics and movements were created.
- **Task 5** In this task the game graphics were created with the Gloss library
- **Task 6** Last but not least, task 6. In this task a game Bot was created which was designed to solve game levels.

## Download
To be able to play the game, you'll need to firstly download tha Haskell Cabal-install and Gloss

### Mac OS 
To install the required packages run the following commands:
```bash
brew install ghc
```
To check if you have cabal-install installed in you machine run the following command:
```bash
cabal --version
```
In case cabal-install is not installed run this command:
```bash
brew install ghc cabal-install
```
Now let's install the Gloss library
```bash
cabal install gloss
```

And now you must be all seted up!
